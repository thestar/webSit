            <h3>202000917 Yi tong Lyu Architectural design</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project is to learn to draw perspectives from the basics. We discussed parallel lines,
                horizontal lines, vanishing points, and one - and two-point perspectives. We need to discuss the use of
                a two-point perspective in a drawing to design a building. We can use the drawing paper to feel the
                different feelings brought by different painting paper. In this assignment, I used rough brown cardboard
                and pencil to draw two perspective coffee shops.</p>

            <p>The goal of this project is to learn to draw perspectives from the basics. We discussed parallel lines,
                horizontal lines, vanishing points, and one - and two-point perspectives. We need to discuss the use of
                two-point perspective in drawing to design some overlapping cuboids, and we use light gray markers to
                show the shadow of light on objects. We can use the drawing paper to feel the different feelings brought
                by different painting paper. In this assignment, I used white paper and light gray marker to draw the
                light and shadow when two rectangles overlapped.</p>

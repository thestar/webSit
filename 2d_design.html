    <p>Introduction of 2D design workes</p>
    <p>In this basic visual composition course, we need to learn the basic elements and principles of vision, we need to
        explore the core design principles of visual organization, unique and challenging methods, and through the
        thinking process and team to obtain the ability to solve problems, dialogue, perceptual refinement and skill
        management, and cultivate analytical ability.</p>

            <h3>20200827 Yitong Lyu Project1 3 feet as a line</h3>
            <p>In this project, we need to drop a 36 inch rope on the floor and use the Friction or the technique of
                rubbing. We need to create 3 rubbings using the above program. In addition to using chalk and chalk, we
                can also experiment with and use short-lived materials. We need to explore different paper and paper
                sizes and surfaces in order to record and record the configuration of the rope on the floor. I used
                white paper and red chalk to create my work.</p>

            <h3>20200910 Lyu Yitong Artist statement Found line collage 2d design</h3>
            <p>In this project we need to separate the best and most interesting examples of lines. We need to cut the
                interesting lines we find into squares. Each grid is 2 inches in size and taped onto a 9 "x 12" tracing
                sheet or directly to the Bristol board. I found lines of interest in magazines and put them
                together.</p>

            <h3>20201007 Lyu Yitong Project4 Value Scale color-aid 2d design</h3>
            <p>In this project, we will use acrylic paint, which includes white, dark blue and burnt brown. We found out
                as the best choice by making 30 grey mixtures. Through this project, we realized that the value / value
                scale is a series of steps, from black to white, with gray in the middle. The value in the scale is from
                light to dark or from dark to light. Each step in a series is a gap between the two sides: half dark,
                one in front, twice as black as the one behind. We need to paint the colors on the paper and cut them
                into small squares 1.5 inches high by 1 inch wide and stick them to the Bristol board.</p>

            <p>In this project, we will use PhotoShop to create an original composition using atmospheric perspective.
                Using images from a mobile phone or camera, we need to compose a work that guides the audience around
                your theme image. Arrange your elements into groups. We need to think of our elements as shapes, and
                then arrange them. We need to make a predetermined focus. We need to use full atmospheric perspective,
                color, contrast to further clarify your design and emphasize your focus.</p>

            <h3>20200917 Lyu Yi tong Project 3 ideations Digital I</h3>
            <p>For this project, we need to express our identity and self portrait. The question raised about this
                project is how do we see ourselves and / or others see you? Do we need to portray ourselves through self
                portraits? These may be beliefs, interests, race, gender, hobbies, etc. In this project, we need to use
                the CIA's digital output center to print our work, which is 16 * 24 inches in size. This printed image
                will be hung in the corridor.</p>

            <h3>20201019LYU YItong Project 5 Digital1</h3>
            <p>We need to use simple visual elements, we need to create a visual message in a simple format. The choice
                of information is the right typography and the application of the design principles you learned during
                the semester. We can use symmetry, asymmetry, pattern, repetition, line, etc. Our final composition
                should be abstract but balanced. message can be humorous, stupid, serious, funny, boring, etc. The same
                work also needs to be printed out through doc. I made it 16 * 16 in size</p>

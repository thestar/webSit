    <p>Introduction of observational workers</p>
    <p>The main objective of observational mapping is to focus on the core mapping concepts; basic methods, tools and
        materials. Through learning from observation, including perspective theory related to objects and environment,
        and introducing the character.</p>

            <h3>20200916 Yi tong Lyu project2 shape landscape</h3>
            <p>Class drawing requires 25 shapes, which are located in an invented space. All shapes need to have
                different sizes, including solid and solid, and transparent appearance. Shape vocabulary includes cubes,
                bricks, cones, pyramids, spheres, columns, and custom geometry. We need to use points 1, 2 and 3
                Perspective technology to make paintings. We need to choose whether the horizon is located north or
                south of the center of the painting. We need to shade the ground from the black on the horizon to the
                light gray to the foreground. We need to express the different shadows that light brings to objects. I
                used B pencil and charcoal pencil and compressed charcoal to finish the homework on 18 * 24 drawing
                paper.</p>

            <h3>20200916 Yi tong Lyu project2 Architecture drawing</h3>
            <p>In this project we need to look for interesting and unique looks. We have to do it according to our own
                architectural taste. Generate drawings with content on high quality drawings. The foreground, background
                area and elements such as trees, streets, cars, public aisles and seats need to be included on the
                drawing paper. We need to focus on the big picture, not every detail. I chose my favorite building
                nearby and finished painting. In terms of tools, I chose to finish painting with pencil and charcoal pen
                for high quality paper larger than 18 * 24.</p>

            <h3>20201014 Yi tong Lyu OPTICAL TEXTURE Project</h3>
            <p>In this project, we will study optical texture as the theme. We need to use two-dimensional texture to
                describe different visual appearances. Optical textures are used to represent and illustrate various
                surfaces or ideas, such as bark, fabric, sand. Textures can contain complex geometric and / or organic
                asymmetric and symmetrical patterns. We need to express the features of contrast, irregularity and
                nature by loose correlation between texture and pattern. I chose to draw two different stone roads. In
                this project, I used more than 18 * 24 drawings and charcoal to complete the work.</p>
